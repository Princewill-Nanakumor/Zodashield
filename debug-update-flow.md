# Debug Update Flow

When you click Save on the Contact Information section, you should see these logs IN THIS ORDER:

## Browser Console:

1. `💾 ContactSection handleSave called`
2. `✅ Validation passed, preparing to save...`
3. `📤 Calling onLeadUpdated with: {...}`
4. `🔄 LeadDetailsPageContent - handleLeadUpdated called`
5. `🔄 Main page - handleLeadUpdated called`
6. `🔄 Updating lead: [ID]`
7. `📦 Original lead data: {...}`
8. `📎 assignedTo...`
9. `🧹 Cleaned payload: {...}`
10. `📡 Response status: 200`
11. `✅ Lead updated successfully: {...}`
12. `✅ onSuccess - Lead updated: {...}`
13. `✅ Updating caches with new data...`

17. `✅ Main page - Mutation result: {...}`
18. `✅ Main page - Refetch completed`
19. `🔄 LeadDetailsPageContent - lead prop changed: {...}`
20. `✅ currentLead updated to: {...}`
21. `✅ onLeadUpdated returned: true`
22. `🏁 handleSave completed`

## Server Console:

2. `✅ Session user: [ID] ADMIN`
3. `📦 Update data received: {...}`
4. `🎯 Lead ID: [ID]`
5. `🔍 Query: {...}`
6. `📊 Current lead found: true`
7. `📝 Update payload: {...}`
8. `📊 Update result: { matchedCount: 1, modifiedCount: 1, acknowledged: true }`
9. `✅ Updated lead document retrieved: {...}`
10. `✅ Transformed lead to return: {...}`
11. `✅ Returning transformed lead`

## What to Check:

If you DON'T see all these logs, tell me where it stops!

If modifiedCount is 0, it means the data wasn't actually different.

If you see all logs but UI doesn't update, it's a React rendering issue.
